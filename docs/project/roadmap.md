# Project roadmap

## Roadmap aligned to the project goal

The user-provided roadmap is correct, but it benefits from calling out a few
enabling pieces explicitly. Some of these are now implemented foundations, while
others remain future work.

### Already identified

1. Create an API to manipulate classfiles
2. Calculate frames
3. Validate the manipulated classfile and generate new classfiles

### Capabilities that should stay explicit in the roadmap

#### 1. A bytecode/classfile writer ([#4](https://github.com/smithtrenton/pytecode/issues/4), [#12](https://github.com/smithtrenton/pytecode/issues/12)) — done

This layer is now implemented via `pytecode.class_writer`. `ClassWriter.write()` serializes `ClassFile` structures back to bytes in spec order, and `ClassModel.to_bytes()` exposes the direct lowering-plus-emission path for the mutable editing model. Emission recomputes derived lengths/counts from the live dataclass tree, preserves imported constant-pool ordering by default, and preserves unknown attribute payloads verbatim.

#### 2. Constant-pool management ([#5](https://github.com/smithtrenton/pytecode/issues/5)) — implemented foundation

Any manipulation API needs to create, deduplicate, update, and reindex
constant-pool entries. That foundation is now present via
`ConstantPoolBuilder`, including spec-aware Modified UTF-8 handling, lookup
helpers, MethodHandle validation, and deterministic ordering, so the roadmap
should treat it as an enabling dependency that subsequent editing/emission work
builds on.

#### 3. Symbolic labels and branch management ([#7](https://github.com/smithtrenton/pytecode/issues/7)) — implemented foundation

Editing bytecode safely required label-based branch targets instead of manual offset arithmetic. That foundation is now in place via `pytecode\labels.py`: labels support forward references, survive instruction insertion/removal, rebind exception/debug metadata, recompute `TABLESWITCH`/`LOOKUPSWITCH` padding, and widen overflowing branches during lowering.

#### 3a. Symbolic instruction operands ([#16](https://github.com/smithtrenton/pytecode/issues/16) — done)

This layer is now implemented in `pytecode.operands`. The editing model lifts the major non-control-flow instruction families to symbolic wrappers for constant-pool references, local-variable slots, `LDC` values, `INVOKEDYNAMIC`, and `MULTIANEWARRAY`, so ordinary transforms no longer need to manage raw operand encodings by hand.

#### 4. Descriptor and signature parsing ([#3](https://github.com/smithtrenton/pytecode/issues/3)) — implemented foundation

A dedicated descriptor parsing utility is needed throughout the library — for
frame computation (establishing initial local slots from method parameters), for
constant-pool management (creating method/field references), for validation
(checking type correctness), and for the editing API (adding methods or
fields). This foundation is now in place and already performs stricter
well-formedness checks, so later roadmap items can rely on it instead of
re-implementing descriptor logic ad hoc.

#### 5. Control-flow and data-flow analysis ([#9](https://github.com/smithtrenton/pytecode/issues/9))

Frame calculation depends on more than raw instruction parsing. A control-flow graph and stack/local simulation layer will likely be necessary for correctness. The simulator must be type-aware (tracking category sizes for long/double, handling null as any reference type) and must understand exception handler entry assumptions (1 value on stack for caught exception type).

#### 5a. Differential CFG validation against external oracles ([#17](https://github.com/smithtrenton/pytecode/issues/17) — done)

`pytecode.analysis.build_cfg()` is now validated against a JVM-side ASM oracle instead of relying only on coarse fixture assertions. The implemented test infrastructure compiles a small `RecordingAnalyzer` helper against ASM, records instruction-level normal and exceptional edges plus try/catch metadata, normalizes them into `pytecode` block spans / successor sets / handler sets, and compares both the broad `CfgFixture.java` corpus and the targeted `CfgEdgeCaseFixture.java` corpus against the Python CFG builder.

#### 6. Class hierarchy resolution ([#8](https://github.com/smithtrenton/pytecode/issues/8) — done)

This layer is now implemented in `pytecode.hierarchy`. Type merging at control-flow join points still belongs to later analysis work, but the required hierarchy queries now have a pluggable, typed foundation.

#### 7. Max stack and max locals recomputation ([#10](https://github.com/smithtrenton/pytecode/issues/10) — done)

Now implemented in `pytecode.analysis` via `compute_maxs()` and `compute_frames()`. These are integrated into `lower_code()` and `ClassModel.to_classfile()` as opt-in via `recompute_frames=True`.

#### 8. Version-aware verification rules ([#11](https://github.com/smithtrenton/pytecode/issues/11) — done)

Now implemented in `pytecode.verify`. The validation module checks version-aware feature gating and attribute constraints alongside structural classfile validation. See `pytecode/verify.py` for the full set of checks.

#### 9. Round-trip fidelity and compatibility testing ([#14](https://github.com/smithtrenton/pytecode/issues/14) — Tier 1 landed)

To be a practical ASM/BCEL alternative, the project should prove:

- parse → emit → parse stability (idempotent round-trips)
- compatibility across representative Java compiler outputs (javac 8, 11, 17, 21)
- verifier acceptance of generated classes (run through `java -verify`)
- preservation of unknown or unsupported attributes where possible
- deterministic emission for reproducible builds

Round-trip testing distinguishes three levels of fidelity:

- **Level A — Byte-for-byte identity** (`bytes₁ == bytes₂`): The gold standard for no-modification roundtrips. Achievable because `ConstantPoolBuilder.from_pool()` preserves original indexes and `lower_code()` handles instruction encoding selection. This is the default expectation for unmodified roundtrips.
- **Level B — Structural equivalence** (`parse(bytes₁) ≅ parse(bytes₂)`): For modified roundtrips where CP indexes may have shifted. Compares parsed structures with CP references resolved to symbolic values.
- **Level C — Semantic equivalence** (behavior-preserving): The weakest level — two class files define the same class with the same behavior, even if structural details differ (attribute order, debug attributes, method order).

Tier 1 is now implemented for the current fixture corpus: `tests/test_class_writer.py` exercises byte-for-byte `ClassWriter.write()` roundtrips across compiled Java fixtures, byte-for-byte `ClassModel.to_bytes()` roundtrips across the same corpus, and raw edge cases such as unknown attributes and double-slot constant-pool gaps. The broader compatibility tiers remain future work.

#### 10. Error and diagnostics model ([#11](https://github.com/smithtrenton/pytecode/issues/11) — done)

Now implemented in `pytecode.verify`. The `Diagnostic` dataclass carries severity, category, location context (class name, method, CP index, bytecode offset), and a human-readable message. The validation entry points collect all diagnostics by default, with an optional `fail_fast=True` mode that raises `FailFastError` on the first ERROR-severity issue.

#### 11. API shape and extension strategy ([#6](https://github.com/smithtrenton/pytecode/issues/6))

The manipulation API uses Design A (direct mutable dataclasses) as the primary editing surface, chosen for its Pythonic feel, low learning curve, and natural fit with the existing `@dataclass`-based codebase. The phased extension plan is:

- **Phase 1 (done)**: Mutable tree model — `ClassModel`/`MethodModel`/`FieldModel`/`CodeModel` with symbolic references, `ConstantPoolBuilder`, and label-based instruction editing.
- **Phase 2**: Pass-style composition — `Pipeline`/`Pass` protocol for chaining transformations. Model transforms as `(builder, element) → None` functions with transform lifting (inspired by the JDK Class-File API). Add matcher-based selection predicates (inspired by Byte Buddy).
- **Phase 3 (if needed)**: Optional visitor layer for streaming — defer until there is an actual use case for high-throughput, memory-efficient bulk transformations.

See [editing model design rationale](../design/editing-model.md) for the full comparative analysis.

#### 12. Debug info management ([#13](https://github.com/smithtrenton/pytecode/issues/13))

Mutation invalidates LineNumberTable, LocalVariableTable, and LocalVariableTypeTable entries because they reference bytecode offsets. The library should provide utilities to rebind debug info after transformation, strip it cleanly, or preserve it through label-based indirection.

#### 13. JSR/RET legacy support

The legacy `JSR` and `RET` instructions (used for subroutine inlining in pre-Java 6 classfiles) are now handled by the opcode table, lowering layer, and analysis/test coverage. They remain a niche compatibility path rather than a modern workflow, because classfiles with version ≥ 51 cannot use them on current JVMs.
